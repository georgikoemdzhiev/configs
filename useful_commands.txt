# TO Export a list of installed packages
pacman -Qqe > packages.txt

# TO Import/install from a file
pacman -S --needed - < packages.txt

# The above will error out as we do have some packages installed from AUR 
# So we can use that command:
sudo pacman -S --needed $(comm -12 <(pacman -Slq | sort) <(sort packages.txt))


# Create a bachup of user directory

tar --exclude='/home/georgi/.cache' --exclude='/home/georgi/.cargo' -zcvpf /run/media/georgi/Samsung_T5/home_dir_backup/$(date +%d-%m-%Y).tar.gz /home/georgi

# Extract the tar archive contents to a specific directory

tar -xzvf home_dir.tar.gz -C /home

# Copying over/restore the home directory 
/bin/cp -rf /zzz/zzz/* /xxx/xxx
or
yes | cp -rf /zzz/zzz/* /xxx/xxx

# Steps that I did:
1. Install fresh Manjaro (I did pick "nonfree" graphics drivers
2. After install, I went to "manjaro-settings-manager" -> "hardware configuration"
and uninstalled the nonfree (i.e. "Prime" video drivers) and installed 430 Bumblebee hybrid drivers
3. Installed Firefox
	3.1. Install "JetBrains Mono" font as it's needed by some of my programs (i.e. the terminal)
4. Copied over the /home directory 
5. Deleted the contents of the "/home/.cache" directory
6. Installed the "packages.txt" file using "sudo pacman -S --needed $(comm -12 <(pacman -Slq | sort) <(sort packages.txt))" command
    6.1. If there is "exists in filesystem (owned by p11-kit)" error when installing the packages from step 6 execute:
    sudo pacman-mirrors -g && sudo pacman -Syyu
7. Repeat step 6

Note: if I upgrade the system before installing my packages, it may not show the error in 6.1. step
